## 💡 About These Images

### Professional SVG Placeholders

These are **high-quality vector (SVG) images** that:
- ✅ Load instantly (lightweight)
- ✅ Scale perfectly on any screen size
- ✅ Look professional and clean
- ✅ Represent each material type accurately
- ✅ Include realistic granule patterns
- ✅ Have appropriate colors for each plastic type

### Why SVG?
- **Vector graphics** = crisp on all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- **Small file size** = fast loading
- **Scalable** = looks perfect at any resolution
- **Professional** = clean, modern appearance

---

## 🔄 Want Real Photos Instead?

These professional placeholders will work great, but if you want to add actual photos of plastic granules later:

### Option 1: Download Free Stock Photos
See `ADD_PRODUCT_IMAGES.md` for:
- Direct links to free image sources (Pexels, Unsplash, Pixabay)
- Specific search terms for each material type
- Step-by-step download instructions

### Option 2: Use Your Own Photos
Take photos of your actual stock:
1. Use smartphone camera
2. Good lighting (natural light best)
3. Close-up shots of granules
4. Save as JPG with correct filenames
5. Replace SVG files in `public/placeholders/`

**Filenames must match exactly:**
- nylon.jpg (or nylon.svg)
- abs.jpg
- pc.jpg
- pmma.jpg
- tpe.jpg
- pom.jpg
- pbt.jpg
- pp.jpg
- masterbatch.jpg

Just drop the new images in the placeholders folder - website will automatically use them!

**POM** - Cream/ivory (typical POM color)  
**PBT** - Warm beige (polyester natural color)
